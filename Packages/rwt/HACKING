PHREAK
Look, you wanna be elite? You gotta do a
righteous hack. None of this accidental shit.

CEREAL
Oh yeah, you want a seriously righteous hack,
you score one of those Gibsons man. You know,
supercomputers they use to like, do physics,
and look for oil and stuff?

= INTRODUCTION
================================================================================

There are a number of ways in which wavelet toolbox might be expanded or
improved. Arbitrary dimension handling or just 3d, non-orthogonal wavelets,
support for other environments, and so on. If you are seeking to implement these
or any other changes, this document will be your launching point. All of this 
applies to the state of the code as of the 3.0 release - if this sentence 
hasn't been updated but the code has then you may assume that some of the rest 
of this text may be outdated.

================================================================================
= DEVELOPER DOCUMENTATION
================================================================================

You will likely want to begin by building the documentation files. You'll need
CMake, Doxygen, and GraphViz. Hopefully you are on Linux, OSX, or some other 
Unix flavor. If you are using Windows as your primary development platform, take 
this time to stop and think about your life and where it's going. Ok, so to 
build the documentation run:
  cmake .
  make doc
After this you should see HTML documentation in doc/html and a pdf with the
same content at doc/latex/refman.pdf

If you haven't used Doxygen before, here's what you need to know: put a ! after
the opening /* in a comment to include that comment in the generated docs, look
at the top of some existing functions to see how function parameters are shown,
and note that you can use latex formulas.

================================================================================
= UNIT TESTS
================================================================================

Before changing anything you should make your way over to the tests directory
from the MATLAB prompt and run:
 runtests
Witness how all of these tests pass. Take care that this is still true after
any changes you make. Now of course you have an IQ that must be measured using
2-byte integers and have never once introduced a bug into computer software,
but these tests are important so that mortals can come along later and know
whether a change they made broke some function of the software or not. 

There are also Python tests at python/test_rwt.py and these are mostly the same
as the MATLAB tests. If you are feeling adventurous you might look into unifying
these into a single script that generates both sets of tests. You should run
both sets of tests before publishing any commit that could concievably affect
them. If you don't know every line of code in both platforms intimately then you
should take the safe route and run both test scripts, and possibly the Octave
tests as well. Unfortunately Octave lacks a lot of things that would be needed
to run MATLAB xUnit.

================================================================================
= TOUR OF THE C CODE
================================================================================

As of version 3.0, all MATLAB-specific C code has been isolated to a few places.
The files in the mex/ directory are MATLAB MEX wrappers for the transforms and
these files are intended to be as short as possible. All the initialization
code common to the different transforms is found in lib/src/init.c and some of
that code is also shared with Python.

The real magic of making things work across different environments is in 
lib/inc/rwt_platform.h - in particular the mat() macro abstracts away memory 
addressing so you don't have to worry about row major order and column major 
order. The rwt_printf, mat_offset, offset_row, and offset_col macros will be
very useful if you need to change any of the code that uses the mat() macro.

To understand the code for the transforms themselves, start with lib/src/dwt.c
which is the best documented of the transforms. The rest of them are written
and structured in a very similar fashion.

The flow of the code is as follows. One of the transforms is called from MATLAB.
This invokes one of the wrappers from the mex directory. The function here calls
rwt_matlab_init in lib/src/init.c which calls other init functions. From here 
the mex wrapper calls the transform in lib/src. For example, the mdwt function
for the discrete wavlet transform calls dwt() in the lib/src/dwt.c file. This
function has a few helpers in the same file. It allocates memory necessary for
the transform in dwt_allocate(), calculates the high and low pass coefficients
in dwt_coefficients(), performs the convolution in dwt_convolution, and frees
the allocated memory in the dwt_free() function.

In the case of Python, a python wrapper function in python/rwt.i calls some of
the same initialization code in lib/src/init.c then decides if the input is 1D
or 2D and calls a matching C wrapper function, also found in the python/rwt.i
file. Finally, this wrapper function calls the transform function found in the
lib/src directory.

================================================================================
= PYTHON / NUMPY
================================================================================

The HardTh, SoftTh, daubcqf, denoise, and makesig functions are implemeted twice 
- once in MATLAB and once in Python. This was simpler than rewriting them in C.
If you change any of these you will be glad to see that MATLAB and numpy are 
extremely similar.

Here follows the differences you may need to know. MATLAB indexes start at 1 and
numpy starts at 0. For three part indexes the order changes - a[b:c:d] in MATLAB
code corresponds to a[b-1:d:c] in Python/numpy. You must use the ddof=1 argument
to the std() function in Python. The size() function in MATLAB returns 2 numbers
for 1D inputs and the same function in Python returns 1 number. MATLAB assumes
additional return values beyond the 1st should be dropped if not assigned to
a separate variable - Python does not.

A quick look over the SWIG/numpy documentation might lead you to think that you
could use OUTPUT_ARRAY or INPLACE_FARRAY or some other macro to change how the
python bindings work to be more reasonable. You are probably wrong. Probably.

================================================================================
= THE BUILD SYSTEM
================================================================================

The CMake build system was selected for its license similarity to Wavelet 
Toolbox itself, though this is not strictly necessary. CMake also allows for
sophisticated results with relatively little work. Anything you want to do will
likely require some searching and playing. You may be tempted to switch to some
other more common build system, but this would probably only make things worse.
